I understand. I will revert to reading from the HTML table as you requested, but I will do it CAREFULLY this time to avoid the timing issues that broke it before.

I will implement `readMRDistributionFromTable` again, but I will make sure it's robust and used correctly in `sendMRDistribution`.

Here is the plan:
1.  Restore the `readMRDistributionFromTable` function in `ControlSidebar.js` that parses the HTML table.
2.  Update `sendMRDistribution` to call this function to get the current state *before* sending to backend.
3.  Ensure I use `querySelector` safely.

I'm making the edits now to restore the HTML reading logic you want.
